# Week 1 

- [Hours](https://github.com/MiguelSombrero/fifteen-puzzle-solver/blob/master/documentation/hours.md)

## Synopsis

- Initialized project
- Started implementing basic structure and classes for 15-puzzle
- Started the documentation
- Explored information about solving 15-puzzles
- Configured checkstyle and other dependencies to pom-file

## Problems

Not really, for now.

## Questions

There seems to be lots of articles about solving 15-puzzle with A* -algorithm. Wondering if I could find some "out-of-the-box" algorithm (an efficient one) to this puzzle.

## Next Week

Should propably start coding game logic and A* with heuristic 1. Also writing first unit tests.
