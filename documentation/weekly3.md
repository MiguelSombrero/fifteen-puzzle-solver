# Week 3

- [Hours](https://github.com/MiguelSombrero/fifteen-puzzle-solver/blob/master/documentation/hours.md)

## Synopsis

- Implemented HashSet data structure
- Trying to improve performance of A* -algorithm with minor changes

## Problems

When trying to solve harder 15-puzzles, I'm getting "OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space" when generating new game states. So it seems that A* -algorithm uses too much space for solving harder 15-puzzles. Still need to investigate possibility to use IDA* -algorithm for harder puzzles.

## Questions



## Next Week

- Implement PriorityQueue data structure
- Try to improve A* -algorithmic performance
